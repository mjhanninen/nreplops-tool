// So the different representations that the result being printed passes through
// are the following:
//
// 1. unparsed result
// 2. list of lexemes
// 3. result value AST
// 4. input structure to layout solver
// 5. input structure to printer
//
// The unparsed result (1) is what we receive from the nREPL server.  This
// is produced by Clojure's printer so it is Clojure but, importantly, very
// restricted form of Clojure.  It does not contain meta data literal and most
// of the reader macros are absent as well.
//
// The lexemes (2) are produced with our Clojure lexer and should be able to
// represent the whole language.  However, as the input result is restricted
// form of Clojure, so the produced lexemes are also a subset of known lexemes.
//
// The abstract syntax tree (3) is capable of representing only a limited subset
// of Clojure; this is effectively the EDN.  It is rich enough so that we can
// formulate the problem for the layout solver and, optionally, translate the
// data into some other form (e.g. JSON, YAML, or CSV).
//
// The input to the pretty-printing layout solver (4) is either a flat list
// or a tree structure.  I'm not sure which one it will be.  In any case it
// conssists of chunks of unbreakable texts together with styling information,
// suggested breakpoints, layout anchors, optional whitespacing, relationships
// between breakpoints and the like.  Things that the layout solver uses while
// determining the optimal layout.
//
// The input to the printer (5) consists of text fragments, style coding
// (separated from the text), line breaks, and spacing.  There is not much
// conditionality at this phase; only the decision whether to include or
// ignore the styling (coloring) when printing according to the alraedy fixed
// layout.
//
// When we are printing unformatted but colored output we can skip the phases
// (3) and (4) produce the printer input (5) directly from the lexemes (2).
//
// When we are converting the results to some other output format (e.g. JSON,
// YAML, or CSV) we follow through the same phases but do the translation
// into the alternative output format when we produce the input for the layout
// solver.
