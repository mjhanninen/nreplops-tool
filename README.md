# nreplops-tool (nr)

nreplops-tool (`nr`) is a non-interactive nREPL client designed to be used in
shell scripts and on the command-line.

## Project status

**Inactively developed:** This is project is under development (i.e. not feature
complete yet, big changes may happen) but receives only limited attention.  The
tool itself is used daily in production environmnets by the author.

## Try it out in 1 minute

This example assumes you are able to install packages with Homebrew.  See the
[Installation](#installation) section below for other options.

Start by installing nreplops-tool (`nr`) and Babashka (`bb`):

```
brew install mjhanninen/sour/nreplops-tool borkdude/brew/babashka
```

Launch a Babashka nREPL server (that listens on the port 1667 by default):

```
bb nrepl-server
```

Open another terminal and evaluate an expression with `nr`:

```
nr -p 1667 -e '(println "Hello, world!")'
```

## Quick examples

Before starting make sure that you have a Clojure nREPL server running in the
background and there is a corresponding `.nrepl-port` file in either the current
working directory or any of its ancestor.

Evaluate the expression `(+ 1 2)` on a nREPL server:

```
$ nr -e '(+ 1 2)'
3
```

Pass the expressions through a pipe:

```
$ echo '(+ 1 2)' | nr
3
```

Evaluate the content of a file:

```
$ echo '(+ 1 2)' > plus.clj
$ nr plus.clj
3
```

Create an executable nREPL scripts:

```
$ cat <<EOF > plus.nr.clj
+ #!/usr/bin/env -S nr -!
+ (+ 1 2)
+ EOF
$ chmod +x plus.nr.clj
$ ./plus.nr.clj
3
```

Suppose the nREPL server had a function called `get-user-by-email` that searched
in retrieved users from the application database by email.  A script exposing
that functionality to the command line could look something like this:

```
$ cat <<EOF > get-user-by-email.nr.clj
+ #!/usr/bin/env -S nr -! --no-results
+ (clojure.pprint/pprint
+   (get-user-by-email db "#nr[1]"))
$ EOF
$ chmod +x get-user-by-email.nr.clj
$ ./get-user-by-email.nr.clj wile.e.coyote@example.com
{:name "Wile E. Coyote"
 :email "wile.e.coyote@example.com"
 :phone "555-555 555"}
```
